ExFlow supports Australian localization.

### Reason Code

Reason Code can be selected from Import Journal, this is efficient for
Credit Memos where Reason Code is mandatory when posting in Approval
Status.

The reason code will be copied to each general ledger -and vendor entry
when the document is posted. Keep in mind that it is only possible to
assign one reason code to document lines due to all lines are posted as
one entry.
