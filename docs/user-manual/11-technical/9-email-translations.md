### Change a current email design

It is possible to change some fields in the Email Translations page. Some fields are hard coded and cannot be changes, but other fields can be modified to get a more customized email for a company.

Filter on the actual ''Language Code'' and on the (Email) ''Type'' and ''Key Value'' that changes want to be made on. 

Edit the list to change Translation for the Email Reminders Type(s). The ''Translation'' text and the changes will be applicable on the next email.

It is recommended to test the changes in a test environment before production environment, to make sure the new email looks and workers as intended.
