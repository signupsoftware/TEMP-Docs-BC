## ExFlow Web

As soon as invoices are created from the Import Journal, the invoices
will be ready to be approved/handled in ExFlow Web for current
approvers.

the invoice lines and image. It is possible to have the list expanded
automatically.

Depending on the permission role on ExFlow User in Business Central, the
user may adjust the line regarding dimensions, change Account etc.

In this case, the user just approves all lines on this invoice by
clicking "Approve" button.

After approval, the invoice will be moved to the Box called "Recent" and
Approval Status in Business Central will be updated. Invoice is also
sent to the next approver if such exists.

"Status" of the invoice and approves the changes done on lines.
