#### Permission on Business Central users
Next step is to add the permission set called *EXCOADMIN* on selected Business Central users, that will handle the configuration of CO₂ Insights in Business Central. 

All other users that will utilize the CO₂ Insights Platform, can have the permission set called *EXCOREADER*. 

One of these permission sets must be given to users in order to access the CO₂ Insights Platform when the configuration is completed.<br/><br/>


#### Onboard in ExFlow CO₂ Insights Setup
Go to **ExFlow CO₂ Insights Setup** 

Head over to ‘’ExFlow CO₂ Insights Setup’’ to start the onboarding for the chosen company.

When the onboarding process is completed and the consent is granted, it will then be possible to enter the CO₂ Insight Platform by clicking on ‘’Onboarded’’. 

This obligates of course that the user has the required CO₂ permission set on the Business Central User card, as previously mentioned.
