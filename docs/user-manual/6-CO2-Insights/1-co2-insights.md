#### Permission on Business Central users
Next step is to add the permission set called *EXCOADMIN* on selected Business Central users, that will handle the configuration of CO₂ Insights in Business Central. 

All other users that will utilize the CO₂ Insights Platform, can have the permission set called *EXCOREADER*. 

One of these permission sets must be given to users in order to access the CO₂ Insights Platform when the configuration is completed.<br/><br/>



#### Onboard in ExFlow CO₂ Insights Setup
Go to **ExFlow CO₂ Insights Setup** 

Head over to ‘’ExFlow CO₂ Insights Setup’’ to start the onboarding for the chosen company.

When the onboarding process is completed and the consent is granted, it will then be possible to enter the CO₂ Insight Platform by clicking on ‘’Onboarded’’. 

This obligates of course that the user has the required CO₂ permission set on the Business Central User card, as previously mentioned.

### The CO₂ Insights Platform

The CO2 Insights Platform is divided into different sections. The first section is called Review, and under this section **Carbon footprint** can be found.

From this page, users will be given an insight into the company's total emissions over a selected period, and emission's intensity. It is also possible to view a dashboard over the monthly breakdown and category breakdown.

Utilize **Explore your footprint** to see and get a better understanding of the company’s emission and delve into its data. Adjust and compare different time periods and see the result divided into categories, scopes, and suppliers.

If some entries aren’t mapped correctly under Emission Sources, we can then utilize the pen and make necessary adjustments. 

For instance, the Emission source ‘’BG Microsoft AB’’ has ‘’Category: Purchase goods’’,
but we will need to change it to ‘’Category: Purchased services’’ and ‘’Sub-category: IT services’’ instead.

From here, it is also possible to choose to ‘’Always use this category for this supplier’’ or ‘’Always use this category for this account’’.

Go under **Review and Adjustments** to view already executed adjustments or edit current data for selected year to get a better calculation of the company’s emissions. It is possible to add or edit company premises, vehicles and machinery or refrigerants.

Under Premises, an office or heated garage can, for instance, be entered together with information about its area, electricity consumption, heating source and consumption.

Under vehicles and machinery, we can also add a company car or other trucks and enter information about the fuel, unit, and amount per year.

Adjustments can also be made for your company's refrigerants, just select the Type and its Amount.
