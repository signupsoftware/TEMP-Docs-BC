## Vendor Card

Go to: **Vendors --> Vendor card**

In ExFlow 23.0.0.0 all settings are moved from the Vendor card and ExFlow Advanced Vendor Options to ExFlow Vendor Setup. This is done automatically when upgrading ExFlow. 

Go to **Related** and click on **ExFlow Vendor Setup** to add ExFlow specific details for a specific vendor.
