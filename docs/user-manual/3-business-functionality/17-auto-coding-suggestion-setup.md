## Auto Coding Suggestion Setup

Go to: ***ExFlow Setup - Overview --> Auto Coding Suggestion Setup*** or search on ***ExFlow Auto Coding Suggestion Setup***

This function in ExFlow is made to be able to get automatic coding suggestions in the Import Journal based on historically posted documents and works for both invoices and credit memos. This can be useful for companies who have posted history in Business Central but just started to use ExFlow.<br/>

*Auto Coding Suggestion* can give coding suggestion if no other suggestion type has been applied, like an ExFlow Purchase Code or Predefined G/L Account. The Auto Coding Suggestion continuously update coding suggestions after posting the documents, to always give an accurate future suggestion.<br/>

**Please note:** This function only support G/L Accounts, not other line types. 

The steps for having a proper Auto Coding Suggestion would be to: <br/>
1. Have posted documents history <br/>
2. Create coding set IDs<br/> 
3. Create suggestions<br/>
<br/>

Or, let ExFlow handle Auto Coding Suggestion via [Periodic Activities](https://docs.signupsoftware.com/business-central/docs/user-manual/business-functionality/auto-coding-suggestion-setup#periodic-activities), where the steps would be to run the reports to:
* Create coding set IDs <br/>
* Create auto coding suggestions<br/>

## Setup 
### Add a New Auto Coding Suggestion

To start with Auto Coding Suggestions, Source Type(s) must be added. It can be a Vendor, an Gen. Bus Posting Group, a Vendor Posting Group or to choose all of them as a last option.
