## Require Approval

Go to: **ExFlow Setup --> General --> Require Approval** 

This function can be used to prevent users to create and also untick the approval flag on purchase document, and post the documents outside of ExFlow.

When this function is enabled then all Invoices and Credit Memos also need to add the approval flag when creating manual documents. 

It will not work to post a document without the approval flag tagged on the document. Following error will then occur:

If Order (or Quote) Approval is activated in ExFlow Setup, then users will be able to release the order but not be able to untick the approval flag from the order/ quote card:
