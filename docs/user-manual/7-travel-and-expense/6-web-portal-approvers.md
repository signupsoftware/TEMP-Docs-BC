## Approver

As an approver, your role involves reviewing and deciding on expense and mileage submissions from assigned users. This includes receiving submissions, evaluating them, and either approving or rejecting them for further processing by the bookkeeping department.

This task is performed on the web portal, which provides a convenient overview of all expenses, mileage, expense reports and per diem waiting for approval. 

### Approval

Go to: **Travel & Expense --> Approval**

The **Approval** list gives the approver two easy ways to approve or reject expenses and mileages.

1.  Open an item, review the attachments and details. Then choose **Approve** or **Reject**.

2.  Use the checkboxes and select one or several items, then use the **Approve** or **Reject** buttons at the end of the list for all items at once.

### Rejection

If the approver rejects an expense or mileage, the approver is required to leave a reason for the rejection, such that the person receiving the rejection may change the issues in question.

#### Approval and Rejection an Expense report
Once the Expense Report is submitted, the approver receives a summary and can approve it all at once or reject all / parts of it.
