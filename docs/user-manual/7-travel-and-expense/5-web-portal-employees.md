### Credit card transactions

Credit card transactions are a popular way to pay for several things, and this also extends to paying on behalf of the company. ExFlow Travel & Expense simplifies reporting these transactions, especially if Credit Card Agreements have been set up, as automatic matching with fitting expense reports becomes possible.

A credit card transaction can be opened from the dashboard, details filled in, and then sent as an expense. If an expense has already been created for the credit card transaction, it can be merged with the credit card transaction.
