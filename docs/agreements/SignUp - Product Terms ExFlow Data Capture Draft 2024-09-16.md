and other issues regarding the ExFlow Data Capture to the Superusers. The Superusers alone may then, 
where the Superusers are not able to answer questions or solve any issues raised by users within the

support shall include basic support to users such as guidance on how to use the ExFlow Data Capture.

and  any  other  information  or  material  necessary  for  SignUp  to  assess  the  issue.  When  SignUp has

screen.

connection for SignUp to the Customer's environment.

Moreover, Support Services will not be provided unless the relevant Subscription Fee for the supported 
ExFlow Data Capture has   been paid.

discretion, to not constitute bugs or defects in the ExFlow Data Capture, are charged at the price for
