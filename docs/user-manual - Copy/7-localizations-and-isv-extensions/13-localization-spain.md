## Localization Spain

### Language

ExFlow support Spanish language in Business Central.

### Invoice Type: SII

Business Central supports the Spanish SII requirements for VAT reporting
(Immediate Information Supply).

### Equivalence Charge (EC)

An Equivalence Charge (EC) is a tax that is used in retail sales and in
activities that do not follow VAT rules. Under EC rules, companies must
pay a surcharge to their vendors when purchasing goods, in addition to
the usual VAT.

Some general posting groups must have an EC percentage in addition to
the VAT percentage. This information is tracked separately, but in order
to minimize changes, both taxes are usually combined.
