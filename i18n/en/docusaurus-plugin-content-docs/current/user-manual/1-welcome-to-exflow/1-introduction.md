## Introduction

ExFlow Business Central is a built-in AP and invoice process automation module for Dynamics 365 Business Central.

ExFlow automates and enhances the end-to-end invoice process: from scanning and data capture, through data import and validation,
pre-coding, invoice matching, approval workflow and final posting to archiving and follow-up.

With ExFlow, Accounts Payable get full control and transparency of the invoice process.

ExFlow is built-into Dynamics 365 Business Central, AP staff continue to work in their familiar Business Central environment with entry and
invoice processing.

End-users do not need to work in Business Central to approve invoices. 
Approvers will receive an email with Purchase Invoices awaiting their approval. In this email, approvers can see relevant Purchase Invoice
details such as the Invoice number. Invoices that are close to or past their due date are highlighted in the email. The email will also
contain a link for the approver to log in to a web-based approval interface, where all Purchase Invoices involving that approver can be
retrieved and viewed.

Approvers see all the invoice details as well as an image of the original Invoice. ExFlow suggests optimal accounting codes, depending on
the setup. If an approver has the appropriate permissions, he/she can also change G/L Account, Dimensions, and even split line amount across
multiple lines. When a user approves an invoice, it automatically moves on to the next person or group in the selected approval flow.

At all times, admins have full control of the invoice process and can cancel or change the approval flow. Search abilities and statistics
provide historic views and analysis of the approval flow processes and handling.

This documentation will provide accounts payable staff and admin users with information about how to set up and use ExFlow functionality. This
assumes that ExFlow is installed, and basic settings have been made before using this.
