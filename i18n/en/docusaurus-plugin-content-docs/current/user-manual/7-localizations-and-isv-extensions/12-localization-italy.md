## Localization Italy

### Language

ExFlow does not support Italian language in Business Central.

The Italian Business Central localization has an amount validation that
is run when posting a Purchase Invoice. The field is called "Total
Amount" and is located on the Purchase Invoice header.

ExFlow will automatically populate this field with the total gross
amount of the invoice when the invoice is created from ExFlow Import
Journal.
