### Dynamic OCR Mapping

Go to: **ExFlow Dynamic OCR Mapping**

Use **ExFlow Dynamic OCR Mapping** for converting an imported customer value to a value that can be recognized. For instance, if a value is interpreted in ExFlow Data Capture for a specific customer, like a Unit of Measure Code called ‘’Styck’’, it can be transformed to ‘’PCS’’ instead and the sales order can be created without error.

All mapping can be shown in the ExFlow Dynamic OCR Mapping list for the respective Table No.
