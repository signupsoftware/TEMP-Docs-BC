## Search Documents

Go to: ***ExFlow History --> ExFlow Search Documents***

ExFlow Search can be used for searching documents for different criteria. By choosing different filters, both Posted documents and Active can be found. Default Company will be the current "Company". It is also possible to set filters on multiple companies.

To be able to search, apply at least two filters. When required filter is entered, push "Apply Filter" to show the result.
